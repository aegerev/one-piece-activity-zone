## The One Piece Activity Center
For more than 25 years, ONE PIECE has been in the hearts and minds of millions. Now, it's nothing short of a CULTURAL PHENOMENON.
So what do you do when you deeply love ONE PIECE but want to showcase your programming skills? You create the ULTI-mate ONE PIECE Activity Center!

## Sections
There are a total of 3 sections:

* "Fruit Powers: Long and Short":
    * This allows you to pick any combination of Power Fruits (like the Gum-Gum Fruit and the Flower-Flower Fruit) and lets you see the longest name of a Fruit and/or the shortest name of a Fruit.
    * ONE PIECE Moment: Power Fruits.

* "Straw Hat Pirates: Keys and Values":
    * This allows you to view the Keys and Values of the Straw Hat Pirates. NOTE: Each one has his/her own page, with his/her own keys and values.
    * ONE PIECE MOMENT: Straw Hat Pirates; the individual pages contain information about each character. 

* "Episode Filtering":
    * This allows you to filter numbers, which are the episode numbers of the show. That way, you can figure out which episode to watch.
    * ONE PIECE MOMENT: "One Piece" (TV show).
 
Each and every activity contains directions for the activity + a "ONE PIECE Moment" - which is just a Fun Fact about the topic provided in ONE PIECE.
